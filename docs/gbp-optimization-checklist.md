- [ ] **Duplicate listings:** One location = one profile only

- [ ] **Stock photos:** Only use real photos of YOUR location

- [ ] **Ignoring reviews:** Respond to ALL reviews within 48h

- [ ] **Fake reviews:** NEVER buy reviews or incentivize them dishonestly

- [ ] **Sparse content:** Empty profiles rank lower (add photos, posts, Q&A)

- [ ] **Wrong category:** Primary MUST be accurate ("Coffee Shop" not generic "Restaurant")

- [ ] **Outdated info:** Keep hours, menu, photos current
