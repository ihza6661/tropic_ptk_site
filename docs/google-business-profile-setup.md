# Google Business Profile Setup Guide - Tropic Coffee

## 📍 Why Google Business Profile Matters for Local Coffee Shop

Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is **THE most important** local SEO tool for Tropic Coffee because:

### **Impact on Local Search:**
- ✅ Appear in Google Maps "coffee shop near me" searches
- ✅ Show up in **Local Pack** (top 3 map results above organic listings)
- ✅ Dominate "coffee shop [street name] pontianak" searches
- ✅ Get directions, calls, and website visits directly from search
- ✅ Display hours, photos, menu, reviews in knowledge panel
- ✅ Rank for hyperlocal queries like "24 hour coffee near me"

### **Expected Results:**
- **Week 1-2:** Profiles appear in searches for exact business names
- **Month 1:** Start ranking for "coffee shop [area] pontianak"
- **Month 2-3:** Appear in "coffee shop near me" when users are nearby
- **Month 3+:** Consistent Local Pack appearances with good reviews

---

## 🎯 Setup Strategy

You'll create **4 separate Google Business Profiles** - one for each branch:

1. **Tropic di Merdeka** - Jl. Hos Cokroaminoto No.326
2. **Tropic di Taslim** - Jl. Taslim No.1
3. **Tropic di Suprapto** - Jl. Aris Margono No.11
4. **Tropic di Kobar** - Jl. Prof. M.Yamin

Each profile will compete independently for local searches in its area.
